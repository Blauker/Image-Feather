# Image-Feather
- This program will change the extension of all your images to '.jpg' and will reduce que quality to compress the file size.
- You can choose between 3 type of quality (30-45-60).
- Really usefull when you need to send/use tons of heavy images.

# How to install
1. Download the .zip file and extract it on a folder wherever you want on your PC.
2. Open "Image Feather.exe" file (I'd recommend to you to create a shortcut into your desktop)
3. Select the quality reduction from the slider.
4. Select the folder when you hold the images to compress.
5. Start.
