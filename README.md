# Image-Feather
- This program will change the extension of all your images to '.jpg' and will reduce que quality to compress the file size.
- Really usefull when you need to send tons of heavy images or your net is slow.

# How to install
1. Download the .zip file and extract it on a folder wherever you want on your PC.
2. Open "Image Feather.exe" file (I'd recommend to you to create a shortcut into your desktop)
3. Select the quality reduction from the slider.
4. Select the folder when you hold the images to compress.
5. Start.
- NOTE: the new images will be saved (replaced) on the same folder.
